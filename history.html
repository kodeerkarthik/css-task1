	<b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard developed over the years to convey information over the internet by using "hyperlinks" - or just links as we know them today. As opposed to a PDF, an HTML page is much more dynamic in nature, letting you browse the web by clicking on links and interacting with the page. Links could take you either to a different location within the current page, or to a different page over the internet. The last version of HTML is HTML 5.0, which has a LOT more capabilities than what the web originally had in mind. HTML 5 is an extremely comprehensive platform that allows creating a high-end user interface together with the power of CSS and JavaScript. HTML 5 is so powerful that it has managed to deprecate Adobe Flash, Microsoft's Silverlight, and just about all HTML plugins such as video players, Java applets, and more. So what is the difference between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? First of all, they can all be encapsulated within an HTML page, meaning that the browser starts by loading an HTML page, and only then it knows what to load from there.  An HTML page is an HTML document that defines the content of the page by using a special markup similar to XML.  A CSS stylesheet defines the style of the HTML elements in the page. It is either embeeded within an HTML page or loaded using the tag.  JavaScript is the programming language used to interact with the HTML page through an API called the DOM (Document Object Model) Bindings. In other words, the DOM Bindings are the glue between the programming language and the HTML page that was initially loaded into the browser. 
	The basics of this tutorial cover HTML and CSS. The advanced sections also assume knowledge in programming and JavaScript. To learn JavaScript, go to https://www.learn-js.org. We will be using a CSS framework called Bootstrap by Twitter, the most common CSS library out there today. The basic principles of a CSS library is pretty much the same - they are all based on the "grid system", which is an easy way to define the layout of an HTML page - a methodology that was developed over the years in web development. </b>
